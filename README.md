# React Movie Database

This repository contains a movie database application built using React. It utilizes various libraries and technologies to create a user-friendly interface for browsing and searching movies.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Movie-Database project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the project dependencies by running the following command `npm install`
3. Start the development server by running the following command `npm start`

This will start the application in development mode and open it in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run eject`: Ejects the app from Create React App.

Please note that once you eject the app, it cannot be undone. Ejecting gives you full control over the build tools and configuration, but it's a one-way operation.
